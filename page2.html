            Imagine a microscopic hero battling one of the planet's greatest threats â€“ plastic pollution. A bacterium that devours plastics. These tiny, unseen heroes are called Ideonella Sakaiensis. They possess the extraordinary ability to break down and consume plastic, offering a glimmer of hope in the fight against one of the most pressing environmental challenges of our time: plastic pollution. Bacteria are commonly associated with illness and infections, with their negative connotations overshadowing their many positive roles in the natural world. From aiding in digestion to promoting nutrient cycling in ecosystems, bacteria are essential for the functioning of our planet. Yet, their contribution to environmental preservation often goes unnoticed. The discovery of the plastic-eating bacteria happened by complete accident. In 2016, this groundbreaking discovery unfolded accidentally. Scientists investigating sludge near a bottle factory stumbled upon bacteria that had evolutionarily mastered the art of 'eating' plastic. This accidental discovery offers a hopeful glimpse into the future of plastic recycling.<br><br>

            <strong>Plastic, plastic, plastic</strong><br><br>

            Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is an environmental nightmare. The plastic is notoriously resilient, rendering it nearly resistant to environmental degradation. Every year, more than 380 million tons of plastic are produced worldwide, 56 million tons being PET. Single-use plastic grocery bags take about two decades to break down. In contrast, plastic water bottles made with PET are estimated to take approximately 450 years to break down entirely, which has made them a notorious type of plastic. After they have served their single-use purpose, many wind up in the environment. Many will end up in landfills, polluting our oceans and countryside, or be incinerated, according to a 2022 report from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Only 9% of the plastic ever produced has been recycled. One result is the infamous trash vortex in the Pacific Ocean that is currently the size of France.<br><br>

            <strong>Into the future</strong><br><br>

            Could this really work? Let's take a step back and think about what would happen if we did use this bacteria for recycling. The idea of a bacteria that can eat plastic appeals to everyone, whether climate change experts or a high school student like myself. Although, the process has its problems. <br>

            While the potential benefits are revolutionary, it is still too early to tell. One significant concern revolves around releasing toxins as by-products during the plastic-eating process. These can potentially harm the environment more than the plastic waste itself, and since they are entirely lab-created, they are untested in the environment. While their effectiveness in controlled environments is noteworthy, their introduction to the unpredictable natural environment remains untested. Laboratories can mimic certain conditions, but replicating them is nearly impossible. This raises questions about how these lab-created microorganisms will interact with the environment's diverse and interconnected web of life.<br>

            Another concern is the control factor. Spraying PET-eating organisms onto the waste vortex in the oceans would spread them virtually everywhere. If more bacteria began eating plastic in the wild, many "durable" products and structures could be threatened. The plastic industry would face the serious challenge of preventing its products from becoming contaminated with hungry microorganisms. Imagine a scenario where PET-eating bacteria, dispersed with good intentions into the environment, start targeting plastic structures. Plastic-based infrastructure, from pipes and containers to certain building components, could be susceptible to degradation in the presence of the bacteria. The very attributes that make plastic resilient against environmental factors could render it vulnerable in the face of microscopic agents specifically evolved to break it down. <br>

            Plastic-eating bacteria represent a newfound hope in the fight against plastic pollution. We all know there is no simple technical fix for this highly complex topic. However, things need to change. Ideonella Sakaiensis offers new hope in addressing plastic pollution, but it is crucial not to rely solely on its potential. Proper plastic waste diversion and recycling still remain essential. Responsible disposal of bottles, packaging, and products minimizes landfill and ocean pollution. While the bacteria brings promise, individual actions in reducing, reusing, and recycling must persist for a sustainable and cleaner future.<br><br>
