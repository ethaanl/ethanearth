                <p>A senior at Mount Douglas Secondary School in Victoria. Born and raised here, I'm captivated by the world, especially climate change. Exploring the trails of Mount Douglas and Vancouver Island is my way of connecting with nature.

                    <br><br>I'm committed to environmental awareness, engaging in school projects and local initiatives addressing climate change. Whether organizing campaigns or participating in clean-up efforts, I aim to make a positive impact.
                    
                    <br><br>Outside of my environmental pursuits, I'm passionate about cooking, using locally sourced ingredients to create delicious meals. As I approach graduation, my passion for environmental stewardship, outdoor exploration, and culinary arts positions me for a future dedicated to positive change. </p>
